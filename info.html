                    <p> is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics,
                        and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include
                        planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova
                        explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background
                        radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates outside Earth's
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made
                        methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians,
                        Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past,
                        astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational
                        astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the
                        same as astrophysics.</p>
                    <p>Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational
                        astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is
                        then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the
                        development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.
                        These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational
                        results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.</p>

                    <p>Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy that employs the principles of physics and chemistry "to
                        ascertain the nature of the astronomical objects, rather than their positions or motions in
                        space". Among the objects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar
                        planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background. Their emissions
                        are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined
                        include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a
                        very broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including
                        mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics,
                        relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.</p>
                    <p>
                        In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the
                        realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include
                        their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes; whether
                        or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and
                        ultimate fate of the universe. Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include
                        Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and
                        evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of
                        cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and
                        astroparticle physics.</p>
